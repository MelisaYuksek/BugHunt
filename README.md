      <h3>A Dream Come True ✨</h3>
      <p>
        As the <b>Lead Organizer</b>, this event holds a special place in my heart. 
        <b>BugHunt has been my dream for the past 2 years.</b> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Bringing this vision to life and seeing it evolve from a simple idea into a massive 11 hour coding night has been an incredible journey. My goal was to provide a realistic, high pressure debugging experience, and seeing the community embrace it was the best reward.

      <hr>
      BugHunt is more than just a competition; it’s an endurance test for developers. We started the journey at 21:00 with a room full of energy and didn't stop until 08:00 AM.

### ☕ The Survivors
**To the Participants:** Your resilience was the highlight of the night. Seeing everyone still hunting at 8:00 AM, refusing to give up on a single bug, was truly inspiring. You guys are the real survivors.
<br> **To the Crew:** A special thanks to my dedicated team. Building these challenges and managing the event flow until dawn wouldn't have been possible without your support.
